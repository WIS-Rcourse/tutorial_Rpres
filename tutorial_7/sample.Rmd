# Rmarkdown demo

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute
code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the **Run** button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r, Car plot, fig.width= 7, fig.height=8 }
plot(cars)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

```{r}
pairs(iris, col = iris$Species, pch = 16)
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
